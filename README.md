# fraud_analytics
An experiment to use machine learning to detect frauds

The purpose of this notebook will be to explore different traditional methods and propose novel ways to work with unbalanced datasets. A dataset is called as unbalanced when the response variable is unusually skewed towards one outcome. Common examples are datasets tracking fraud transactions and customer churn. One of the biggest challenge working with such datasets is that while building predictive models, the algorithm choose to just ignore the minority outcome. As such, analysis of unbalanced datasets requires special attention and approach.

In this example, I am using an anonymized credit card transaction dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud">Kaggle</a>.
